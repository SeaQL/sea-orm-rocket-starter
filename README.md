# SeaORM Rocket Starter

This project intends to be a project template for you to clone and start writing a web service on the Rocket + SeaORM stack.

It exposes a REST API performing OLTP on a relational database (MySQL or Postgres).

It has unit tests (on SQLite) built-in as well as GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

Probably, some day, we will name this project template "Rust on Rocket" ðŸš€!


Requirements Postgres >= 13
